    <title>Recipe for Ghana jollof</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Favorite meal</h1>
       <p>I agree with Virginia Wolf when she said,"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, 
    if one has not dined well." Food plays a very essential role in helping us live comfortably and healthily.
    Not just any food does the trick,but Ghana jollof does it for me.
     Jollof rice with chicken and salad is one of my favourite foods.</p>
    <h2>Origin of meal</h2>
       <p>For some years now,there has been a Ghana-Naija war, concerning where jollof originated from
       and which tastes better. On November 4th,Google doodle celebrated 'Jollof Day' from which we larnt that
       jollof rice is an authentic West African dish prepared with tomatoes,onions,pepper and other local spices.
       The origins of jollof can be traced to the <b>Senegambian region</b> that was ruled by the Wolof Empire in the 14th
       century,spanning parts of today's Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania where rice was grown.
